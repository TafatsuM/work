Welcome to the first installment of the Apollo project! This is a website called “Apollo”, a Yelp-like clone. Reproduced from Codecademy Ravenous Project.
In Development process, there are four parts to this project:
• Creating Static Components
• Passing Information to Components
• Setting the State of Ravenous Components
• Interacting with the Yelp API

Over the project, you utilized the React library, importing and exporting components, the Yelp API, props, and more to achieve a fully functioning Yelp-like clone.
